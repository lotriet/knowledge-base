# Design Patterns in C# - Complete Guide

A comprehensive reference for implementing design patterns, SOLID principles, and OOP concepts in C#.

## Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers. This guide demonstrates practical implementations in C# with real-world examples.

## Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms, increasing flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Factory Pattern** - Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder Pattern** - Constructs complex objects step-by-step
- **Singleton Pattern** - Ensures only one instance exists

### Behavioral Patterns
Handle algorithms, responsibilities, and communication between objects.

- **Observer Pattern** - Notifies multiple objects of state changes
- **Strategy Pattern** - Makes algorithms interchangeable at runtime

### Structural Patterns
Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

- **Adapter Pattern** - Converts incompatible interfaces
- **Facade Pattern** - Simplifies complex subsystems
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstracts data access logic

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** .NET 8.0 SDK or later

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PAtterns
dotnet run
```

## Learning Path

1. **Creational Patterns** → Understand object creation
2. **Behavioral Patterns** → Learn object interaction
3. **Structural Patterns** → Master object composition
4. **SOLID Principles** → Write maintainable code
5. **Dependency Injection** → Achieve loose coupling

## Use Cases

Perfect for:

- Learning design patterns from practical examples
- Interview preparation and technical assessments
- Creating teaching materials for software architecture
- Quick reference during code reviews
- Architecture discussions and design decisions
